Ah, I see! In that case, you can use unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalous transactions that may be indicative of fraud. One approach is to use clustering algorithms to group similar transactions together and identify any transactions that fall outside of the normal clusters.

Here's an overview of how you can use unsupervised learning with Brain.js and React to detect fraud in bank transactions using unlabeled data:

Collect a dataset of bank transactions, including information about the amount, date and time of the transaction, and location of the transaction.

Preprocess the dataset by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables (e.g. converting string values to numerical values).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. In unsupervised learning, the testing set is not used for evaluation as there are no labels.

Define the architecture of the neural network using Brain.js. You can experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the best model for your dataset.

Train the neural network using the training set. During training, the neural network will learn to recognize patterns in the data and group similar transactions together.

Use the trained neural network to cluster the transactions in the testing set. You can use a clustering algorithm such as k-means to group the transactions together.

Identify any transactions that fall outside of the normal clusters as potential anomalies. These transactions may be indicative of fraudulent behavior.

Integrate the anomaly detection model intoa React web application. You can create a dashboard that displays the user's transaction history, highlighting any transactions that the model flags as potential anomalies.

Here's some sample code to give you an idea of how to implement this:

First, you can create a component in React to render the user's transaction history:

dra
This component defines a table that displays the user's transaction history, including the amount, date, location, and whether the transaction was flagged as a potential anomaly by the model.

Next, you can define the trainAnomalyDetectionModel() function using Brain.js:

dra

This component defines a table that displays the user's transaction history, including the amount, date, location, and whether the transaction was labeled as fraudulent or not.

Next, you can define the trainFraudDetectionModel() function using Brain.js:
